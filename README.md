# ***Neural Network for Breast Cancer Prediction***

This project develops a simple feedforward neural network with 3 layers and a total of 12 neurons to predict breast cancer. Using a built-in dataset, it achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 98% on both the training and test sets, demonstrating robust performance in binary classification tasks.

## ***Features***

Binary Classification: Implements a neural network for distinguishing between two categories (e.g., benign and malignant).

Data Preprocessing: Handles and preprocesses data efficiently using pandas.

Data Visualization: Explores relationships and correlations in the dataset with seaborn.

## ***Installation***

To run this project, youâ€™ll need:

- Python 3.12

- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow

**Install the required dependencies using pip:**
```bash
*pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow*
```

## ***Usage***

Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook.

The built-in dataset is loaded and processed automatically within the notebook.

Run the notebook to:

- Train the model.

- Evaluate its performance.

- Visualize the results.

Outputs include metrics such as prediction accuracy (~98%) and insights from visualized relationships in the data.
